// The code you provided defines a class called `Calculator1`. This class contains three methods:

class Calculator1  {

    // result.

   // The `int cube1(int value1)` method is attempting to calculate the cube of the input value.

   // not defined in the method's parameter list or within the method itself. This code will result in
   // a compilation error.
